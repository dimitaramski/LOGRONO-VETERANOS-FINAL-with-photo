The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack football league management application following an iterative approach based on user feedback. Initial work focused on core features: divisions, teams, scoring, standings, user authentication (admin/team), and player statistics. The AI then enhanced the UI with a light black with yellow theme, implemented Shadcn UI components, and added features like yellow/red cards, admin fixture editing, team logo support, live match status, an Instagram blog, and full multi-language (Spanish/English) support with responsive mobile design. Key challenges included debugging frontend delete functionality, handling token expirations, and ensuring consistent UI/UX across devices and features, which were addressed through direct file modifications and iterative testing via screenshots. The project has evolved from a basic concept to a feature-rich application.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a modern, sleek Liga Veteranos Logro√±o football league website with 1st and 2nd divisions (12 teams each). Key functionalities include team logins to update scores, weekly fixtures linked to standings (3 pts win, 1 pt draw, 0 pts loss). Standings must display: Position, Team Name, Games Played, Won, Draw, Lost, Goals Given, Received, and Aggregate. The design should be light black with yellow, inspired by emergent.sh.

Further requests evolved to include:
*   Admin user to create random schedules (and later full schedule management), manage users, teams, players, fixtures, and Instagram posts.
*   Ability to add player names, track goals for a top scorers list (player name, team, goals).
*   Visitors view fixtures/standings; consideration for a subscription model.
*   Yellow/Red cards tracking for players.
*   Calendar-based fixture management for admin with full edit capabilities (goals, cards, scorers).
*   Option to add photo/logo for every team, displayed in standings and fixtures.
*   Fixtures page enhancements: dropdown filter for weeks, clickable matches to show goal scorers/cards/minutes, live match status (live/halftime).
*   Homepage blog section for Instagram links (scrollable carousel).
*   Spanish as primary language with an ES/EN language switcher.
*   Responsive mobile design with a hamburger menu.
*   Player management in admin panel: divide players into team folders (pending).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several UI/UX refinements based on user feedback. The most recent completed tasks include:
1.  **Full Homepage Translation**: Ensured all elements on the homepage, including division names, feature boxes, and calls to action, are correctly translated when switching to Spanish.
2.  **Mobile Responsiveness**: Implemented a sleek, responsive design for mobile devices, featuring a hamburger menu for navigation (Fixtures, Standings, Top Scorers, Language Switcher, Login) to prevent overcrowding the navbar.
3.  **Dropdown Contrast Fix**: Corrected a UI issue where dropdown menu text was invisible on hover due to white text on a white background, ensuring proper contrast with black text on white hover background.
4.  **Instagram Carousel**: Fixed the Instagram post section to display as a horizontal, scrollable carousel on both desktop and mobile, with a scroll hint, glass-morphism effect, and dark cards.
5.  **Delete Functionality**: Fixed issues preventing admin users from deleting Instagram posts, teams, or other entities, ensuring all delete buttons function correctly with proper feedback.
6.  **Navigation and Branding**: Added a logo next to the league name in the top left and made the feature boxes (Weekly Fixtures, Live Standings, Top Scorers) on the homepage clickable with hover effects.

The work concluded with a highly functional and aesthetically pleasing homepage, responsive design, and core features, with the navigation, language switching, and Instagram section fully operational and visually refined.
